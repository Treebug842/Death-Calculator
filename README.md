# Death-Calculator
At first glance this may seem pretty stupid... and that is because it is. It seems sort of dark, but I actually made it as a motivational thing. Some people will look at this and feel sadness or regret, but others will look at it and strive to improve their life. We all know how old we are and can probably do the math of how long we theoretically have left to live, but I thought it would be fun to visually see how much time you have left.

how it works is simple; it assumes that you will die at 80, and each block represents a month (so 12 x 80 = 960 blocks). Once you enter your date of birth it will subtract that date from the current date and convert it into months (how many months you have been alive) and if the days are closer to being a month it will round up. It then colours in the time you have lived.

Hope other people find this interesting XD
